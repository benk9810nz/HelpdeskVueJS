# Helpdesk Hours Monitoring Website

As part of my studies at the Southern Institute of Technology, I am a Helpdesk Student Manager, responsible for the co-ordination and management of the student helpdesk at the Library.

As part of my role, I am responsible for tracking how many hours each student has done, and how many they have left to do.

In order to allow students to see a summary of their total hours complete, and remaining hours left to do, I have created a simple website which retrieves values from a JSON File to allow the students to see these hours.

To retrieve these values, they are stored in a JSON File, and are retrieved via AJAX, which is facilitated through the use of the Vue.js JavaScript Framework.

This JSON File is stored within a directory in this GitHub Repo, and is retrieved when the user visits the website. All I need to do is to update the file regularly, and the students are able to see their current hours.

A student can see their Current Hours (updated every Friday), by selecting their Student ID from the dropdown which will update the information in the Table. A copy of the timetable is available below the roster, and the students can contact the appropriate Helpdesk Leader via the hyperlinks at the bottom of the page.

To allow the other Helpdesk Leader to update the information for the students in their location (Cafe), I have shared this GitHub and added them as a collaborative, allowing them to update their Timetable Image, and Update the JSON File.

The finished Website can be viewed at https://benk9810nz.github.io/HelpdeskVueJS/
